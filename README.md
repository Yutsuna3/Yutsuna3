I always try my best to make whatever I work on as great as it can be, because seeing my projects out in the world is one of the many goals I want to achieve. I always have ideas running around my head and is constantly looking for ways to make them come true, one of the ways I do this is by drawing out my ideas, creating stories, and more. When it comes to any projects I'm working on, I love to talk about the various ideas I have and get some input or feedback, whether it's on how to make everything organized or whether it's to add onto any of my ideas.
